# SYSTSOLV

I made this after 2-3 hours of expanding and substituting from a 3 variable system of equations. After checking it and writing down the proof, I used the formulas I came up for x,y, and z and made it so that this program could show its work while computing the answer to a 3 variable system of equations. This completely gets rid of the annoying math needed for these really tedious sorts of problems. It can also be used to check to see if you have done the system correctly by checking the work. The only down side to this program is that it can only display decimals, rather than fractions. It will also crash if the system is unsolvable. But otherwise, it works! If you want to see the proof, just ask me.

The text files allow for easy observation of the code with out the ti connect editor.
